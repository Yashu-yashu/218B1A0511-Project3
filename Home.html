    <p>Shopping for a laptop can be daunting. Over a dozen major manufacturers release new models every year. While some companies are more reputed for producing higher-quality products, even the best laptop brands sometimes release models with design flaws or too many compromises. Also, there are often complaints of poor quality control, inadequate after-sale customer support, and other issues associated with a particular manufacturer. As you may have guessed, there isn't really a best laptop brand, as it depends entirely on your needs and preferences, though quite a few, like Apple, ASUS, Dell, and Microsoft, stand out.

        We've bought and tested over 120 laptops, including models from over a dozen brands, and below are our recommendations for the best brands for laptops. The order in which these laptops appear in the article doesn't represent any ranking; they're listed alphabetically. For more options, check out our recommendations for the best laptops, the best business laptops, and the best gaming laptops.</p>
